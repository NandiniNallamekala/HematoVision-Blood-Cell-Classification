## 📌 Project Description
HematoVision is an AI-based medical image classification system developed using Transfer Learning to classify blood cell images into four categories: Eosinophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, and Neutrophils.  
The model uses a pre-trained MobileNetV2 Convolutional Neural Network to achieve high accuracy and faster training performance.

This project helps automate blood cell analysis for healthcare diagnostics, reducing manual workload for pathologists and improving accuracy in medical analysis.
